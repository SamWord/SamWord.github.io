<p>My name is Samantha Word, but I generally go by Sam. I am a senior at College of Charleston majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics and Astronomy.</p>
<p>I am currently a Ruby on Rails developer for MUSC. The primary application that my teammates and I work on is <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sparc-request/sparc-request">SPARCRequest</a>. SPARCRequest is an open source application used by multiple unstitutions across the US. It is best described by our README: </p>
<blockquote>SPARC (Services, Pricing, and Applications for Research Center) is a web based research management system that integrates research and clinical care workflows with a focus on service request catalog, billing compliance, proposal and budget development, work fulfillment data collection, invoicing and billing, and impact data through grants and publication associations.</blockquote>
<p>When I am not studying or working, I love to cook. I find cooking to be immensely rewarding, especially when I perfect a recipe made from scratch. It's just as rewarding as creating a piece of software, and it provides a meaningful break from technology. Someday, I would like to be a Software Developer or Engineer with a garden full of fresh vegetables.</p>
