<h2>Welcome!</h2>

  <p>My name is Sam Word, and Iâ€™m a Senior Computer Science student at College of Charleston. Today, this blog is being maintained as a part of CSCI 362, instructed by <a href="http://compsci.cofc.edu/about/faculty-staff-listing/bowring-jim.php">Dr. Jim Bowring</a>. However, I am enthusiastic about Software Engineering, Architecture, and Design, so I plan to update this site regularly on various things I work on or find interesting. For now, feel free to check out my <a href="https://github.com/SamWord">GitHub profile</a>.</p>
