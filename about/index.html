<h3>About This Site</h3>
<p>This site is hopsted by <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, and is styled using <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>. Please note that as of August 2017, this site is a work in progress. At the moment, I am using this site to fulfill course requirements for CSCI 362, and to keep a working knowledge of HTML and CSS. The site's content and layout are subject to change. If any blog content is updated, I will try to include the date it was edited. </p>
