<div class="question">
  <h3>4.6</h3>
  <span>Suggest how an engineer responsible for drawing up a system requirements speicification might keep track of the relationships between functional and non-functional requirements.</span>
</div>
<div class="answer">
  <p>An engineer could determine the functional and non-functional requirements of a system before developing a system, then write out the requirements in such a way that closely related functional and non-functional requirements are visually closer together, or draw lines to closely related requirements. Similar to modelling classes in UML, being able to have a visual representation of the relationships between functional and non-functional requirements allows the engineer to have a better grasp of their relationships.</p>

<div class="question">
  <h3>4.7</h3>
  <span>Using your knowledge of how an ATM is used, develop a set of use cases that could serve as a basis for understanding the requirements for an ATM system.</span>
</div>
<div class="answer">
  <ul>
    <li> <strong>Use Case: </strong>Deposit cash and checks:
      <ul>
        <li>Primary Actor: Owner of a bank account</li>
        <li>User inputs their bank account and PIN number.</li>
        <li>If their credentials are correct, allow them to deposit cash and checks together.</li>
        <li>Credit the user for the amount of cash and amount specified on the checks.</li>
        <li>If the credentials are incorrect, do not allow money to be deposited.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li> <strong>Use Case: </strong>Withdraw cash:
      <ul>
        <li>Primary Actor: Owner of a bank account</li>
        <li>User inputs their bank account and PIN number.</li>
        <li>If their credentials are correct, allow them to enter the amount of cash they wish to withdraw.</li>
        <li>If their account contains at least the amount of specified cash, withdraw the amount of cash specified from the user’s account. If not, do not output any cash.</li>
        <li>If the credentials are incorrect, do not allow money to be withdrawn.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li> <strong>Use Case: </strong>User does nothing:
      <ul>
        <li>Primary Actor: Owner of a bank account</li>
        <li>User inputs their credentials correctly and does not choose an action.</li>
        <li>User is logged out after 60 seconds of inactivity.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li> <strong>Use Case: </strong>Load Cash into ATM:
      <ul>
        <li>Primary Actor: ATM Maintenance Worker</li>
        <li>Maintenance worker enters maintenance mode with admin credentials.</li>
        <li>Maintenance worker selects option to load cash.</li>
        <li>Maintenance worker loads cash into ATM.</li>
        <li>ATM counts cash loaded, verifies amount is correct to Maintenance Worker.</li>
        <li>If cash count is incorrect, return cash, repeat process.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
