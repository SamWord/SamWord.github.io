<div class="question">
<h3>18.4</h3>
<span>Why is it impossible to infer the emergent properties of a complex system from the properties of the system components?</span>
</div>

<div class="answer">
  <p>It is impossible to determine the emergent properties of a complex system from its components because emergent properties can only be distinguished after the system components are integrated. Emergent properties of a complex system are highly dependent on how its system components interact, which isnâ€™t possible to entirely determine in a complex system by examining the components individually.</p>
