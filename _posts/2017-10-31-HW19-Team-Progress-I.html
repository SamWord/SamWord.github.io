<p>So far, our project has met all of the deliverable deadlines with ease. My team has been fantastic about working together remotely over Slack and making use of the time we have together in class to work on this project. At the beginning of this semester, none of us had any experience with Bash scripting, and only Kyle and I had any experience with Ruby on Rails applications. At this point in the project, all of us are familiar with Canvas and writing simple Bash scripts. Overall, our experiences with this project were not as difficult as expected, however, we overcame a few notable obstacles.</p>
<p>First, we had some difficulties installing our chosen H/FOSS project, Canvas LMS. We found that the all-in-one installation script provided in the Canvas repository was outdated and failed before it finished installing. This wasn’t too much of an issue for us because we wanted to set up the application manually at least once regardless of the all-in-one script. The biggest issue with installing Canvas was installing the required dependencies, particularly, a customized jQuery gem. Canvas uses a custom fork of jQuery 1.7.2 with a minute change. When Canvas’s asset management tool, Yarn, tried to retrieve the code from that jQuery repository, it complained about an Invalid Tar Header coming from the source of the repository. Unable to get the custom jQuery to install, we tried installing various other versions of jQuery. Eventually, we found that jQuery version 2.2.4 installed and allowed us to start a local Canvas server. Everything seemed fine until the homepage loaded, and the page seemed oddly sparse. We continued to struggle with jQuery for a while before finally deciding to submit an issue on Canvas’s GitHub page. While writing the issue, we decided to reset the jQuery version used by Yarn to get a screenshot of the issue, but that seemed to fix our problem. We’re still not entirely sure what fixed the issue we were having, but we included some steps and asset files that were only mentioned in Canvas’s Production Start Guide that seemed to fix our problem.</p>
<p>Our next biggest obstacle was finding a way to run specific model methods without access to the entire Canvas code base or a testing database. In Ruby on Rails, all model classes extend Active Record, a class that maps object instances to a relational database so that they can be persisted. This isn’t an issue for writing unit tests in RSpec, but it made it difficult to write unit tests that are external to Canvas. After some research, we found a gem called activerecord-tableless which allows us to essentially bypass Active Record. Once we were able to install this gem, writing and running tests became fairly simple.</p>
<p>At this point, I am highly satisfied with the effort that my teammates and I have put into our project. We have all advanced our knowledge of testing practices and scripting. Additionally, everyone has gone above and beyond to ensure this project succeeds and meets deadlines.</p>
