<p>My team, Don’t Test Me, has made excellent progress on our team project. We have essentially finished our csore project. We have implemented 25 passing test cases for five different model methods in Canvas, and the test cases are displayed in an HTML page. This past deliverable was fairly straightforward since we implemented a test superclass called Testatron. In fact, I was able to implement a set of five test cases in less than 10 minutes. I am extremely happy that we were able to design our test suite in a way that made it easier for everyone on the team to implement future test cases. This also means that our test suite should be easy for others to build on in the future if the want.</p>
<p>I’m also extremely pleased that everyone on my team has made an effort to properly build this project and has committed themselves to meeting each deadline on our timeline. I have no doubt that our last few deliverables will run just as smoothly!</p>
