<div class="question">
<h3>21.4</h3>
<span>Explain why program inspections are an effective technique for discovering errors in a program. What types of error are unlikely to be discovered through inspections?</span>
</div>

<div class="answer">
  <p>Program inspections are extremely effective because they allow a developer who wasn’t involved in writing the program to look at it. I’ve personally had numerous code errors discovered by formal and informal code inspections. Most of the time, program inspections catch errors that I overlook after looking at the same program for a long time such as simple syntax errors, incorrect logic, etc. Formal program inspections, such as reviewing pull requests on GitHub, tend to reveal more nuanced errors such as web page styling that doesn’t meet the program’s requirements.</p>
  <p>Despite being an effective technique for discovering errors, program inspections do not usually reveal errors that arise when multiple components are connected. Program inspections are great for catching errors at the unit level, but not at the system level.</p>
