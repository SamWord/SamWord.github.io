<div class="question">
  <h3>17.10</h3>
  <span>Your company wishes to move from using desktop applications to accessing the same functionality remotely as services. Identify three risks that might arise and suggest how these risks may be reduced.</span>
</div>

<div class="answer">
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Ideally, the remote services should not be affected due to the way they are remotely distributed. The remote services can appear more like a single system by using Middleware to map resources referenced by a program to remote physical resources.</li>
    <li><strong>Quality of Service:</strong> In order to reduce the risk of a distributed system providing poor quality services, the Quality of Service requirements should be defined in advance. This is especially important if the system deals with audio streams, video streams, or other critical data. Once the Quality of Service requirements are defined, it can be determined whether or not those requirements can be met given the available resources.</li>
    <li><strong>Security:</strong> This is a major issue in distributed systems because often the components of a distributed system are managed by separate organizations with mutually incompatible security mechanisms. Whenever possible, each component of a distributed system should be secure so that it canâ€™t be compromised via some other compromised component.</li>
  </ol>
