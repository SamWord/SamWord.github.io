<div class="question">
<h3>21.4</h3>
<span>Explain why an object-oriented approach to software development may not be suitable for real-time systems</span>
</div>

<div class="answer">
  <p>Real-time systems have strict timing constraints. Object-oriented development is centered around hiding data and reading or modifying that data using getter and setter methods. Using getter and setter methods, however, can result in a loss of performance, which may make meeting those strict timing constraints impossible.</p>
  <p>Additionally, real-time systems are process-oriented, not object- or component-oriented. Process-oriented systems focus more on efficiently sending data between hardware. Object-oriented development do not accurately represent the underlying architecture of process-oriented systems.</p>
