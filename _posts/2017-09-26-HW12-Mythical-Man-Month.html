<p>I found chapters 1-4 of <a class="italic" target="blank" href="http://stono.cs.cofc.edu/~bowring/classes/csis%20602/docs/The.Mythical.Man.Month.F.Brooks.pdf">The Mythical Man Month</a> to be quite interesting, not entirely because I learned numerous new concepts (I did learn a few things), but because Brooks explained in detail several things I learned to be true about software engineering and project management through my own experiences. For instance, the central theme of the book is that “Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later” (Brooks 25), which is something I have observed in small-scale settings. Several months ago, a large feature went into the main application I work on at my internship just a few days before the latest version was sent to systems integration and customer testing. Unfortunately, the complicated logic driving that feature was incorrect, but something about the feature made it unable to be removed from the branch we were using for the next release (I would explain why, but I was not involved in this issue). Many things went wrong in the creation of this feature, but as deadlines approached, our choices were limited, so two developers stepped in to help the original developer. The new developers, who were already acquainted with the larger system, still took more than a day to become familiar with the specifications of the feature. It took several more days to actually get the feature working. In the end, the release date was delayed by about a week. This isn’t much compared to the delays of some projects, but for my team of 9 developers who release new features and fixes every 12 weeks, this was a significant delay for something seemingly small.</p>
<p>Another interesting thing I noticed in this reading was the observation that programmers and project managers tend to be too optimistic about the time it takes to complete a project. I am certainly guilty of this. Over the summer, I took charge over a somewhat large UI refactor of an outdated portion of the application I work on at my internship. I originally estimated the project to be finished in November 2017, including unit testing. Now that it’s almost October 2017, and having experienced several complications, I realized I was probably too optimistic. Luckily, the project is a low-priority project, so the release date can be moved back. In the future, I know to plan for the fact that I, like many other software developers, am often too optimistic.</p>
<p>If there were an easier way to estimate time, and realize that we are often too optimistic, more projects might not fall behind schedule. But, as Brooks explains, this is one of the difficulties of project management that is difficult to overcome. If we underestimate how long a project will take to complete, then it will either be late, or be incomplete compared to the original vision. If we overestimate the time it takes to complete a project, the resulting product may be obsolete come time to release it. He did note, however, that projects tend to follow a set timeline better if at least half of the schedule is devoted to testing since we tend to be the most optimistic about testing and creating bug-free software.</p>
<p>The last&mdash;actually one of the first&mdash;things I noticed about Brooks’ book was how he consistently referred to programmers, project managers, and other professionals as men. In fact, the title is <em>Mythical <strong>Man</strong> Month</em>, in reference to the number of men assigned to a project. This didn’t hinder my ability to read and understand Brooks’ observations, but it was certainly distracting. In fact, his only reference to non-male people in chapters 1-4 was explaining that “the bearing of a child takes nine months, no matter how many women are assigned.” This was a good example for tasks that have sequential constraints, it was bothersome that the only mention of a non-male was in reference to a woman giving birth. While this reading assignment was a worthwhile read, I felt as though it was never talking about me or people like me, despite being a software developer. In this book, women are mothers who give birth, and men are programmers, managers, surgeons, etc. It felt as though it was specifically referencing male developers, further solidifying the stereotype that programmers, and professionals in general, are men.</p>
