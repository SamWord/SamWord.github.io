<div class="question">
  <h3>5.3</h3>
  <span>You have been asked to develop a system that will help with planning large-scale events and parties such as weddings, graduation celebrations, and birthday parties. Using an activity diagram, model the process context for such a system that shows the activities involved in planning a party (booking a venue, organizing invitations,,etc. ) and the system elements that might be used at each stage.</span>

<div class="question">
  <h3>5.5</h3>
  <span>Develop a sequence diagram showing the interactions involved when a student registers for a course in a university. Courses may have limited enrollment, so the registration process must include checks that places are available. Assume that the student accesses an electronic course catalog to find out about available courses.</span>

<div class="question">
  <h3>5.8</h3>
  <span>Draw a sequence diagram for the same system. Explain why you might want to develop both activity and sequence diagrams when modeling the behavior of a system.</span>
</div>

<div class="answer">
  <div class="text-center padding-top-bottom">
    <img class="image" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/5.8.png" alt="5.8 ATM Sequence Diagram">
  </div>
  <p>It is important to include both activity and sequence diagrams when modeling the behavior of a system because activity diagrams model the flow of a use case and sequence diagrams model the interactions between objects in a use case. Each diagram offers a unique point of view to form a more accurate model of a certain behavior, reducing the number of misunderstandings between the client and developer.</p>
