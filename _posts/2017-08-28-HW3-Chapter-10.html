<div class="question">
<h3>10.6</h3>
<span>Explain why it is reasonable to assume that the use of dependable processes will lead to the creation of dependable software.</span>
<div>
<div class="answer">
<p>Software that was created using dependable software processes means that the software was created using standardized and robust techniques, and redundant and diverse validation and verification. Dependable processes are also auditable, meaning that people not a part of the process can understand the process as well, so that others can verify that standards were enforced during software development. Also, dependable processes are documentable so that the process documents what activities are to be in the process, and documentation is made during those activities.</p>
<p>Assuming that software created using dependable processes is similar to assuming that a building is dependable if it was created using dependable processes. We generally determine whether or not buildings are safe if they were built using dependable materials, the building was built to meet certain codes, and the builders used proper construction techniques. Software is created using much different processes, but if those processes are dependable, then the software should also be dependable.</p>

<div class="question">
<h3>10.10</h3>
<span>It has been suggested that the need for regulation inhibits innovation and that regulators force the use of older methods of systems development that have been used on other systems. Discuss whether or not you think this is true and the desirability of regulators imposing their views on what methods should be used.</span>
<div>
<div class="answer">
<p>Innovation in software requires regulation. Creating software, unlike solving physical science problems, is bound only to a set of requirements made up by humans. Creating software to do something new is possible, but if that software is not dependable, then I believe that the software is not truly an innovative piece of software. Sure, the software may introduce a novel concept, but if itâ€™s not dependable, then the software can cause frustration, economic loss, or physical damage. Solutions that can introduce more problems, are often not solutions at all, and therefore not innovative.</p>
<p>Though they may feel restricting at times, regulations are often in the best interests of creating dependable software, and generally desirable. However, not all regulations may be desireable. Our ideas of right and wrong change, and our standards of safety change as we learn more about health and the environment around us. In order for a regulation to be desirable, it must be periodically revisited in order to reflect the most recent standards for health, safety, ethics, environmental impact, etc. Out of date regulations can be detrimental to our society because they allow for potentially unsafe software to be in use.</p>
